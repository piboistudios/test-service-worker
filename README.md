# Service Worker Test
This is a simple test of the JS ServiceWorker API.

It will cache all static assets (HTML, CSS, JS), and after the first visit, the page will render even offline.


## Instructions
- Clone the repo
- Run the server (runs at port 9000)
```
node serve
```
- Navigate to localhost:9000 (or localhost:9000/index.html)
- Shut the server down
- Try reloading the page.
